 Tank Game
 
 - Use Arrow keys/WASD to move. 
 - Use Q or / to launch to the other side.
 - Use Space and Enter to shoot.
 
 - The outside charger shows your bullet power. 0% will shoot down,
50% will shot straight, 100% will shoot up.
 - The inside charger shows your jump charge progress if your bar 
is at 75%,you can shoot up/down.
 - Destroy the other turret by breaking through the wall
 and shooting the turret in under sixty seconds.
 - Get the powerup for unlimited ammo.
 
 KNOWN BUGS:
 - Two people cannot move at the same time, because 
 processing can only process-(haha get it?) one function
 at a time.
 
 - Shooting the the turret arm does not damage the
 turret -- It only makes it ANGRY
 
 - Tracer code is NOW VERY inneficient. For better performance
 comment out the tracer class caller.
 
 - For even better performance comment out the explosion class caller.
